        boneless chicken and includes potatoes. You will absolutely love how quick and easy it is and this is definitely

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4>Rice </h4>
            <p> The best choice of rice for Biryani is Basmati rice as they are considered to be premium quality
                rice.
                They are long grain and have distinct aroma. The rice grains remain separate and fluffy. Basmati also
                require less water for cooking and they have a shorter cooking time as compared to the other types of
                rice.
                Jasmine rice are the second best option.

            <h4>Meat</h4>
            <p>Biryani can made with any meat, chicken( with bone or boneless), beef, mutton and even seafood (
                fish or prawn). Chicken Biryani is by far the most popular. I used boneless chicken as its the quick
                option. If you are looking for recipe with boned chicken try Chicken Biryani or Hyderabadi Dum Biryani
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Potatoes</h4>
            <p>
                The one popular debate is – Biryani with potatoes or without . I’m all in for Biryani with
                Potatoes ! A lot of people disagree and according to them a vegetable has no place in a meat dish. It’s
                completely up to you to decide but do try it with potatoes.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Spices</h4>
            <p>
                Biryani gets all its aroma and taste from spices used. Different type of chillies ( powder,
                whole, dried) give their own distinctive taste.
            </p>
            <p>Red chilli Powder, Turmeric, crushed chilli, Cumin seeds, whole red dried chilli, coriander powder and
                garam masala add flavour to chicken. Cardamoms, cinnamon, cloves, black pepper corns and star anise make
                rice fragrant.</p>
        </li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Prepare Chicken Gravy</h3>
            <p>Begin with preparing chicken gravy by frying onions, garlic ginger and then add chicken. Cook until it
                changes colour and add spices. Add yoghurt and cook until water from yoghurt evaporates and oil starts
                to separate. Add potatoes and fry them for couple of minutes. Lastly add tomatoes and green chillies.
                Allow it to simmer on low heat. The gravy should not be runny or watery. It should be dry and thick so
                it coats the rice well.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Boiling the rice</h3>
            <p>Boil water along with all aromatic spices and salt. Add rice and boil them until they are around 70-80%
                cooked. Drain the excess water.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Layering up Biryani</h3>
            <p>Layering up Biryani is last but the important step in biryani recipe. It involves layering up half cooked
                rice and chicken curry. You will need a big pot preferably one with thick base. Layer some rice in the
                pot followed by chicken gravy and layer the remaining rice. Add coriander, mint and green chillies.
                Drizzle some food colour and cover the pot.

                This a crucial phase in biryani as it helps rice to cook fully and absorb the flavour and aroma from the
                chicken gravy. Keep the flame really low so that the rice don’t stick to the bottom. Don’t be tempted to
                open half way through as it releases the heat building up inside and will leave the rice uncooked. </p>
